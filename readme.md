## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/joyboi-ai/Video-Downloader.git](https://github.com/joyboi-ai/Video-Downloader.git)
    cd Video-Downloader
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    * **`yt-dlp`**:
        ```bash
        pip install -U yt-dlp
        ```
    * **`ffmpeg`**:
        ```bash
        # On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems (like Pop!_OS)
        sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
        # For other operating systems, please refer to ffmpeg.org/download.html
        ```

3.  **Make the script executable and create a global command:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x ytdl.py
    # This creates a symbolic link, allowing you to run 'ytdl' from any directory
    sudo ln -s "$(pwd)/ytdl.py" /usr/local/bin/ytdl
    ```
    **Note:** You might need to open a new terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` if `ytdl` isn't immediately recognized.
